# Always Run (.bat) Files With elevated permissions. 

So, all this does is, it makes every .bat file to be run in Administrator mode (Yes, when you double click a bat file it opens as Administrator)

Actually, this is a bit dangerous too, lets say you downloaded a bat file and it contains a virus or whatever, and you have this script enabled. Yea u know the point.

So, Use at your own risk.





## Deployment
You just need to double click the script... (rofl)

## Final Words

Yea, thats it, And also its the 31st Dec 2022 (means its the last day of the year!)
Happy new year, and use the script with care ~
